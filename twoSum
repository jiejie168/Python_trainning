1. Two Sum
Easy
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        '''
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype List[int]
        '''
        # a silly solution !
        # m=len(nums)
        # for i in range(m):
        #     for j in range(i+1,m):
        #         if nums[i]+nums[j]==target:
        #             return [i,j]        
        
        # a more effecient method
        rest={}
        for i, value in enumerate(nums):
            n=target-value
            if n not in rest:
                rest[value]=i
            else:
                return [rest[n],i]
